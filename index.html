                    <h4>AGNES KIM<small>STUDENT</small></h4>
                    <p>	I am 19 year old female passionate about technology and programming. I am currently a second year student intending on studying Computer Science and Education at the University of Virginia.</p> 
<p>	My hobbies include a wide variety of things such as, cooking - I love trying new recipes. To making crafts and paintings, for home decor. </p>
<p>	My family has always been passionate about technology. My grandfather started a startup which helped create software to teach English to Korean citizens after the Korean War. My mom was a software tutor for students in Korea, and both my brother and I study computer science at the University of Virginia.</p> 
<p>	I am interesting in learning about web technologies. I am a self-learner and very motivated, and currently am going through a variety of pluralsight courses online to become better at web development. I have a background in Java and C++, and learning PHP, HTML5, Jquery, CSS and MySQL through coursework (Databases and Web PL) as well as through online courses.</p>

                    <h3>EDUCATION PASSION</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>I think the key to great teaching seems to be more alchemy than science, synthesis of inspirational hocus-pocus and endless drive of dedication and perserverance. My life’s mission is to find this key through my knowledge as a programmer and as a teacher.  In Barack Obama’s State of Union Address, he mentioned the word “change” notably and perpetually. What was his underlying message when he talked about this “change?” I believe “change” is referred to the new generation of technology and education. Nearly all aspect of society is swayed by technology in some form. Technology does not replace teachers, but instead allows them to further share their knowledge and expertise with society. Teachers partake in an important role in educating and inspiring the future pioneers, founders, and innovators that will change the world. From Barack Obama’s State of Union address, when he said “by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one,” this statement caught my attention. As I was listening to his speech, I felt that Obama was inside my head and articulated exactly what the future for elementary teachers would be. Without early childhood instructors, this “change” cannot commence. Elementary teachers play a pivotal role in shaping a child’s character by implanting the right ideals and preparing them for later education. They set the foundation for dreamers that will make an impact in the world. As a programmer and an educationist, I want to give back to society by applying my passion and insight about technology to the growing education system.</p>

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <p>I took a class called Modern Software Development(CS 2110) during the spring semester of 2015. Professor Nada Basit assigned a project to the class to develop an Android game application with the theme of "ghost hunter." Each team had 4 members. There were specifications that had to be upheld such as having a splash screen and a simple functionality of a game that people could play. Because of this project, it introduced Agile programming method called Scrum. Scrum is basically an agile framework for managing complex projects. It's a software development methodology that focuses on teamwork in order to build a functional product.</p>
                    <p>My role was the Quality Assurance Manager. I was in charge of the fuctionality of the game. As a quality assurance manager, I had to ponder about challenging situations about the functionality of the game. I was essentially a "tester", seeing if the game worked whenever the code was updated.</p>

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <p>I am currently taking Web Programming Languages, and I was assigned a project to create a simple online store. There were specifications: the buyers can buy any item by adding it to the shopping cart and then check out. After checking out, a summary of what the buyer bought is played on the browser. If the buyer does not check out, the items in the shopping cart ramin and will be displayed again once the buyer logs in again. If the user does check out, the next time the user logs in, the shopping cart will be completely empty. This project mainly focuses on the languages of PHP and HTML in conjuction with flat files, forms, cookies, and sessions </p>
